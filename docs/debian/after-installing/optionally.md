### Add locale

*preferably, do it before installing any apps*

```
sudo locale-gen bg_BG.UTF.8

sudo update-locale LANG=bg_BG.UTF-8

sudo locale-gen
```

*`bg_BG.UTF.8` used as an example*

If, for some reason that method doesn't work, uncoment your locale from `/etc/locale.gen` and then:

```
sudo locale-gen
```

Don't forget to change language, time and locale settings in the GUI system settings + **add BG keyboard layout**
